# location_distance_calculator

## Product Requirements:

1. Displays the userâ€™s last known location 
2. Asks the user to pick one of the following cities:  Chicago, New York, Paris, Singapore
3. Calculates and displays the distance from #1 to the city picked in #2

Feel free to use any 3rd party library to solve the problem.


## Please notice that:

1. User's last known locations is get by `Geolocator` package. when app starts, it will ask for permission to get user's location.
2. I was planning to use google map but it requires API key, so I use `flutter_map` package to display map and `latlong2` package to calculate the distance.

## Basic Usage(Testcase)

1. Open App, display current location on the map
